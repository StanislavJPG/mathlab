## Math-related web-site

#### Here you can find:
- Solver (You can automatically solve your math equations, matrices, etc. by using a single input!)
- Drafts (You can create your own mathematics drafts using drawing functionality and use it or share it with other theorists if you want!)
- GraphBuilder (Build any graph that you want!)
- Forum (Fully math-integrated forum like stackoverflow.com or znanija.com)
- Community (Almost like social mediaðŸ˜Š! Look for friends and communicate with them via chat, drafts, comments, etc.)
- Chat (Share your achievements, posts, comments, drafts or just send audio or text-messages to the any theorist in one place! Or just find new friends in math area!)


### About this project

### Installation

**Copying project from GitHub:**

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/StanislavJPG/mathlab.git
```

* Create your own .env file by the .env.template in main directory.
* ```make up``` to create docker images and starts the containers.
* Open the second terminal for the ```make web``` command. It will run bash console.

**Then run in console:**
* ```./manage.py migrate``` - to apply all the migrations in the database.
* ```./manage.py loaddata post_categories``` - to create the categories in the database.
* ```./manage.py loaddata mathlab_carousels``` - to create the carousel data.
* ```./manage.py loaddata math_news``` - to create the dummy math news **(optional)**.
* ```./manage.py createsuperuser``` - to create your own superuser (which is designed only for auth purposes).

After superuser creation make sure that you have registered 
directly from the site form to properly create your own `Theorist` model, which is related to the `User` model.

**NOTE:** You should grant admin permissions by selecting the `superuser status` checkbox for your recently registered user. The admin-panel URL path: `admin/`

#### And that's it! Now you can jump into it!
